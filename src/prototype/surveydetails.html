        Understanding the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on NHS staff mental health, coping and well-being
    </h1>
    <p>
        You are being invited to take part in a study looking at the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental
        health, stress and resilience of NHS staff in the Hywel Dda region. Before you decide if you wish to take part,
        please read the below information to understand why the research is being conducted and what it will involve.
    </p>  
    <h3>
        What is the purpose of this project?
    </h3>
    <p>
        Aberystwyth University, in partnership with the Hywel Dda University Health Board, are interested in
        determining the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has on the mental health, stress and resilience of NHS
        staff over the next year. As well as looking at how the pandemic affects staff, we are interested in which staff
        may be more or less impacted, and in how best the health board can help to safeguard the wellbeing of staff.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Why have I been asked to take part?
    </h3>
    <p>
        You have been asked to take part as you are a member of staff working for Hywel Dda University Health Board
        during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are interested in looking at the effect that this pandemic has on a wide
        range of NHS staff and roles, including those who stay in their usual role, those who perform a new role during
        the pandemic, and those who may be required to work from home during this time period.
    </p>
    <h3>
        What will happen if I take part and how long will the study last?
    </h3>
    <p>
        If you would like to take part in the study, you need to complete the consent form at the end of this information.
        Each month, you will be asked to submit answers to several questionnaires asking about how you are feeling at
        the time. You will be able to withdraw from the study at any time, and in that case, your data will be deleted.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Will my participation be confidential?
    </h3>
    <p>
        All personal information relating to you (e.g., contact details) will be kept confidential and stored separately to
        your response data. Your employer will not be told whether or not you are participating in the research, however
        co-investigators at Hywel Dda will have access to the anonymised datasets. Data will only be made available to
        third parties, or to Hywel Dda University Health Board, in an aggregate and anonymised form. Anonymised
        data sets may also be made available for other researchers in accordance with open access policies to avoid
        duplication of research and transparent comparison of research results.

    <h3>
        GDPR compliance
    </h3>
    <p>
        GDPR stands for the General Data Protection Regulation. In the UK we follow the GDPR rules and have a law
        called the Data Protection Act. All research using personal data must follow UK laws and rules. Universities,
        NHS organisations and companies may use data to do research to make health and care better. Universities and
        the NHS are funded from taxes and they are expected to do research as part of their job. They still need to be
        able to prove that they need to use personal data for the research. In legal terms this means that they use
        personal data as part of ‘a task in the public interest’.
        If they could do the research without using personal data they would not be allowed to get your data.
        Researchers must show that their research takes account of the views of ordinary members of the public. They
        must also show how they protect the privacy of the people who take part. A research ethics committee checks
        this before the research starts.
        This research is being conducted in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation guidelines. The data
        controller for this project will be Aberystwyth University (AU). The AU Data Protection Manager provides
        oversight of AU activities involving the processing of personal data, and can be contacted at
        infocompliance@aber.ac.uk. Your personal data will be processed for the purposes outlined in this notice. The
        legal basis that would be used to process your personal data will be ‘a task in the public interest’. If you are
        concerned about how your personal data is being processed, please contact AU in the first instance at
        infocompliance@aber.ac.uk. If you remain dissatisfied, you may wish to contact the Information Commissioner’s
        Office (ICO). Contact details, and details of data subject rights, are available on the ICO website at:
