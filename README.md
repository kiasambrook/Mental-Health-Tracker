# Mental Health Tracker
This is a student built project to track the mental health of staff members in the NHS (not in association), and was built for the module Software Engineering for the Web during my second year of university. This was created in collabroation with my group members: Bethany Watkins, Rebecca Andrews, Deni Kovačević, Alex Kerrison, and Anton Duffin. 

My role in the project was the backend developer and group leader, and we achieved a final grade of 72% for this project.
